# Simon
A remake of the orginal simon electronic memory game written with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Gameplay involves watching a pattern of colors being played and repeating the pattern. The pattern increases in length for each correct pattern inputed. Score is calculated based on the number of correctly inputed patterns and is displayed once a mistake is made while inputing a pattern. 


Multiple JS libraries were used including JQuery and Tether to simplify programming as well as Bootstrap (developed by Twitter) which was used for the premade buttons, windows and interfaces.
HTML and CSS were used to create a GUI that could be viewed in modern browsers and JS was used for the gameplay aspects, sounds and scene changes.
